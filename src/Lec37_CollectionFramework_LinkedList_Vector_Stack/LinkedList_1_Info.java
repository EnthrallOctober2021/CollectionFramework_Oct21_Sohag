package Lec37_CollectionFramework_LinkedList_Vector_Stack;
/*
LinkedList implements the List,Collection interface. 
It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements. 
It can store the duplicate elements. 
It maintains the insertion order 
not synchronized. 
**In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.

*capacity: no initial capacity (it constructs the empty list without any initial capacity)



Some Commonly used methods
****************************
addFirst()
addLast()
get(0)ðŸ¡ªspecific value 
set(0,ï¿½?xxxxxxï¿½?)â€”to set(replace) specific index value
removeFirst()
removeLast()
We can print by using: advance for loop, iterator, while loop
*/



/*Topics to be covered:
 2-Basic Idea by creating LinkedList-->add(), get(), size() Print  and...show them by debugging(prev node & Next node) & image
 
 3-use of diff method: add & remove elements in first&Last position, set(). clear etc
 
 4-raw, Heterogeneous & generic type....print approach
 
 -Customized type(do it again) to revise prev class
